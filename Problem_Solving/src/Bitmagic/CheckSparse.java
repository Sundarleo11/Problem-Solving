/*
Given a number N. The task is to check whether it is sparse or not. A number is said to be a sparse number if no two or more consecutive bits are set in the binary representation.

Example 1:

Input: N = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Binary Representation of 2 is 10,
which is not having consecutive set bits.
So, it is sparse number.
Example 2:

Input: N = 3
Output: false
Explanation: Binary Representation of 3 is 11,
which is having consecutive set bits in it.
So, it is not a sparse number.

Your Task: The task is to complete the function checkSparse() that takes n as a parameter and returns true if the number is sparse else returns false.


Expected Time Complexity: O(log N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
